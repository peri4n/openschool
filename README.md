# Open school

OpenSchool is a project I started to learn about React and Redux at a production scale.
As time goes by, maybe it grows to something bigger.

## Development

You first have to start all services OpenSchool depends on. 
As everything is set up using Docker-Compose you can start these by running:

```sh
docker-compose --profile dev up
```

Now you can start the development server by running:

```sh
npm run serve
```
